# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 09, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I've Started making my own personal blog, starting from scratch, using html, css, js and php.

**Thoughts :** I've gotten rusty after 5 months after quitting my job, thinking of learning something new, but before that, need to warm up a lil.
Events that happened in last 5 months
- got most of social accounts hacked including losing my github and linkedin accounts, recovered them both, but lost all the projects and progress that i had in my github, fuck github support.
- gave few PG entrances, figured that i'd fail, yet i did pretty well for myself for a prep of 3 months.
- officially closed my debts of my failed startup.
- html css php ain't easy, CRUD is testing my patience.
