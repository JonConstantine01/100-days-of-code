# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 09, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I've Started making my own personal blog, starting from scratch, using html, css, js and php.

**Thoughts :** I've gotten rusty after 5 months after quitting my job, thinking of learning something new, but before that, need to warm up a lil. 
Events that happened in last 5 months 
- got most of social accounts hacked including losing my github and linkedin accounts, recovered them both, but lost all the projects and progress that i had in my github, fuck github support. 
- gave few PG entrances, figured that i'd fail, yet i did pretty well for myself for a prep of 3 months.
- officially closed my debts of my failed startup.
- html css php ain't easy, CRUD is testing my patience.

### Day 2: July 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Set up a basic file structure for the blog — index, about, blog-posts. Started working on header and footer includes.

**Thoughts**: Remembered how irritating it is to manage repeated elements manually. PHP includes = sanity saved.

### Day 3: July 11, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Built a dynamic navbar using PHP includes and some basic responsiveness with CSS. Also wrote a quick blog post manually in HTML to test layout.

**Thoughts**: Not bad. Feels good to see something visual after writing lines of div soup. Still hate CSS.

### Day 4: July 12, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Hooked up a basic MySQL database and started creating a `blog_posts` table. Inserted some test data manually via phpMyAdmin.

**Thoughts**: SQL feels oddly satisfying — until you get that one syntax error that ruins everything.

### Day 5: July 13, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started with PHP + MySQL integration. Wrote some code to fetch blog posts from the DB and render them dynamically on the home page.

**Thoughts**: Seeing dynamic content load from the database — that dopamine hit is real.

### Day 6: July 14, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Created the single post view page. Clicking on a blog post now shows the full content. Routing is basic but functional.

**Thoughts**: Manually writing URL parameters isn't cool — maybe I’ll explore .htaccess rewrite rules later.
