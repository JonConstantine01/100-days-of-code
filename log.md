# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 09, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I've Started making my own personal blog, starting from scratch, using html, css, js and php.

**Thoughts :** I've gotten rusty after 5 months after quitting my job, thinking of learning something new, but before that, need to warm up a lil. 
Events that happened in last 5 months 
- got most of social accounts hacked including losing my github and linkedin accounts, recovered them both, but lost all the projects and progress that i had in my github, fuck github support. 
- gave few PG entrances, figured that i'd fail, yet i did pretty well for myself for a prep of 3 months.
- officially closed my debts of my failed startup.
- html css php ain't easy, CRUD is testing my patience.

### Day 2: July 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Set up a basic file structure for the blog — index, about, blog-posts. Started working on header and footer includes.

**Thoughts**: Remembered how irritating it is to manage repeated elements manually. PHP includes = sanity saved.

---

### Day 3: July 11, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Built a dynamic navbar using PHP includes and some basic responsiveness with CSS. Also wrote a quick blog post manually in HTML to test layout.

**Thoughts**: Not bad. Feels good to see something visual after writing lines of div soup. Still hate CSS.

---

### Day 4: July 12, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Hooked up a basic MySQL database and started creating a `blog_posts` table. Inserted some test data manually via phpMyAdmin.

**Thoughts**: SQL feels oddly satisfying — until you get that one syntax error that ruins everything.

---

### Day 5: July 13, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started with PHP + MySQL integration. Wrote some code to fetch blog posts from the DB and render them dynamically on the home page.

**Thoughts**: Seeing dynamic content load from the database — that dopamine hit is real.

---

### Day 6: July 14, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Created the single post view page. Clicking on a blog post now shows the full content. Routing is basic but functional.

**Thoughts**: Manually writing URL parameters isn't cool — maybe I’ll explore .htaccess rewrite rules later.

---

### Day 7: July 15, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Designed a minimal theme — soft background, serif fonts, just enough spacing. Also fixed some layout glitches.

**Thoughts**: Aesthetic progress makes technical frustrations feel lighter.

---

### Day 8: July 16, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Took Down, the blog progress for testing the index page, wanted some responsiveness and made css changes for it.

**Thoughts**: was trying to figure ssh, as github flagged my account, had to shift to another one, ssh login is crazy, bluehost support and youtube helped me out.

---

### Day 9: July 17, 2025

**Today's Progress**: spent a whole day, thinking about color code, meanwhile the responsiveness hit and was crazy in small phones and css is set for the index.

**Thoughts**: Admin Pages still pending, waiting for the day to finish it, meanwhile finding peace in insert statements and create tables.

---

### Day 10: July 18, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on about page and, projects management page, figured the logic for tables in mysql.

**Thoughts**: wish i had more ram in my brain, feeling sleepy after i fail.

---

### Day 11: July 19, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Tables are set for the projects and tags, about page location php errors also fixed.

**Thoughts**: Small UI improvements make a big difference. Momentum’s building.

---

### Day 12: July 20, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Deployed the project in my domain using bluehost. Next step is to clean the code and complete other pages and officiate the admin pages.

**Thoughts**: From nothing to working blog in 12 days — it’s slow, but steady. Gaining confidence back bit by bit.

---

### Day 13: July 21, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Working on the admin pages, meanwhile checked some open source projects and explored listmonk and on topics about creating a mailing server

**Thoughts**: Easy to focus and work when someone's not breathing in your neck.

---

### Day 14: July 22, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Deploying something via heroku, thanks to github, stuck on it for 5 hours, deleted countless apps, destroyed databases, only to realize in the end, the mistake was in procfile.

**Thoughts**: felt like a win figuring it out but sad for the lost time.

---

### Day 15: July 23, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Check few contests in Codedex, its fun, but a waste of time, tried to automate github and leetcode series.

**Thoughts**: Just duh! feels like being too far away.

---

### Day 16: July 24, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Explored olama and tried to configure it in local.

**Thoughts**: Blank today.

---

### Day 17: July 25, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Successfully Built the logic for the Admin pages in php and tested the prototypes, was able to restart some codedex challenges and DSA.

**Thoughts**: Waiting to finish the portfolio web.

---

### Day 18: July 26, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Dang, forgot to login to codedex, hosted my admin pages and worked on its css, glad it worked asap after making some stupid mistakes, got it up and runnin.

**Thoughts**: i am spending too much time in it, need to increase quality hours and make space for else.

---

### Day 19: July 27, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Explored further on codedex, nothing to be surprised about, had contacted heroku support for DB Connection errors, meanwhile, explored php fundamentals on sessions and storage.
